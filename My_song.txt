I only wanted to have fun
Learning to fly, learning to run
I let my heart decide the way
When I was young

Deep down, I must have always known
That this would be inevitable
To earn my stripes, I'd have to pay
And bare my soul

I know I'm not the only one
Who regrets the things they've done
Sometimes I just feel it's only me
Who can't stand the reflection that they see
